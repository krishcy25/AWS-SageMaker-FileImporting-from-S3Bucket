AWS SageMaker is extensively used in Cloud environment to build Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. AWS SageMaker uses datasets/data from S3 Bucket. Importing the datasets from S3 Bucket is not straight forward similar to "Anaconda-Jupiter Notebook or Spyder"


This repository focuses on code to import the datasets from S3 Bucket into SageMaker and use them to build/train Machine Learning models in AWS SageMaker. For code, Please check the file available with in this repository under " AWS_SageMaker_FileImporting.ipynb"
